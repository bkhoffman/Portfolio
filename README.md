# Portfolio
*This is who I am and what I've done.*
https://bkhoffman.github.io/Portfolio/

## Purpose:
This site is a way to tell you who I am, my professional background and to display my work along my journey to become a web developer.

## How it works:
The main page of this site has my social links to my professional sites, in the header for easy access.  Then you start by clicking one of the sections: About, Portfolio, Resume or Contact.
This will pop up a modal with the info you seek.  You can then click on any clickable links to the different projects I've built and/or continue to work on.  You can also view/download my resume and Contact me if desired.

## Functionality to add:
I will continue to update and expand on the projects I'm working on and add them to my portfolio. I may also update the look of the profile.

## Contributors:
I, Brad Hoffman, am the sole contributor to this site.  I have worked with other contributors on some of the projects and have highlighted them in the ReadMe files of those projects.
